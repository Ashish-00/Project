    <h1>Client Discovery Tools, techniques and best practices</h1>
    <p>
      The client discovery process is essentially a fact-finding mission
      centered around learning as much as you can about what your customer
      needs, what their goals look like, and what their challenges and
      expectations are.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The more you know about your clients as a sales or account manager, the
      more likely you are to build consistently positive connections with them.
      Clients who feel heard also tend to feel satisfied. So it’s no surprise
      that more than two-thirds of companies compete primarily on the basis of
      customer experience.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      When you undertake a new client discovery, you’ll typically need to source
      and analyze a variety of information – not just about your customer and
      their business, but about their audience and competition as well.
