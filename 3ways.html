    <h1>3 Ways to Get Client Approval for Scope Changes</h1>
    <h3>1. Build a Change Management Process into the Project Scope</h3>
    <p>
      When your agency and the client are negotiating the project scope, include
      a change management process in the scope of work. This puts everyone on
      notice that this project and budget aren't endlessly malleable. It gives
      you and the client a chance to discuss how you'll handle incorporating new
      facts or priorities that may emerge during the course of the project,
      which includes potentially changing timelines and budget.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Having a change control process outlined in the SOW also makes getting
      client approval easier and faster when the situation does arise because it
      takes the personal pushback out of the equation. You simply refer back to
      the SOW.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>2. Create Regular Check Points for Client Approval</h3>
    <p>
      on't wait until all the creative for a campaign is done to get approvals,
      or even mostly done. Build checkpoints into the plan so clients have a
      chance to respond before the negative impact of changing course becomes
      considerable.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>3. Outline Key Tasks in the Statement of Work to Educate the Client</h3>
    <p>
      Here's another example: You send over a landing page outline, and the
      client responds by saying that she wants to promote a new product, not the
      one your team researched and tested in an effort to better understand the
      buyer's needs and concerns.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      When your SOW spells out the tasks and timelines required to execute the
      project, it's very easy to help your client understand the volume of work
      your team has already invested, and why these last three weeks of effort
      can't be recycled into new focus. It puts your agency on much stronger
      footing in the negotiations to get paid for the work done and to get the
      additional budget and deadlines needed to shift gears in such a big way.
